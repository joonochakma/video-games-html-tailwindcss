        We look at everything from the first video games ever made on a massive
        computer to the latest video game on a mobile phone. The timeline we
        will look at is from the 1940s to the 2020s.

        In this era, computers were very large (the size of a room). Computers
        were used by the military to enhance their combat, as computers could
        generate thousands of solutions each second. Although the computers were
        so big and expensive, few games were invented, such as Nimrod, OXO
        (tic-tac-toe), tennis for two, and Spacewars! Now you might be wondering
        why the video game Pong isn't here. But we'll get to that later.
        Although these computers have the ability to create and compute video
        games, only scientists and military personnel have access to them due to
        their size and cost. The ENIAC computer cost the government $400,000.

        Computers grew in size during this period, from the size of a room to
        the size of a refrigerator. This allowed other universities to own more
        computers because of its size. However, they were still expensive, with
        the PDP-1 costing around $120,000. A team at the Massachusetts Institute
        of Technology (MIT) used the PDP-1 to create a new computer game called
        SpaceWar! The game SpaceWar also inspired the creator of Atari, for
        which he created the famous game Pong. Although there has been
        discussion that Pong was the first computer game, Pong was the first
        commercial computer game, selling around 150,000 units. Even though Pong
        is a video game. Pong didn't use any programming language and completely
        relied on electrical hardware, such as digital logic gates. This was
        different from the video game that inspired Nolan, such as Spacewar!,
        that was actually developed in Assembly, a type of low-level programming
        language that is intended to communicate directly with a computer's
        hardware.

        During the late 1970s or early 1980s, video games were starting to
        become more popular. With arcade machines only costing around $2000 to
        around $20,000, which is still less than the 1960s price of computers,
        With computers becoming cheaper, more computers are becoming more
        powerful, and more arcade machines have the ability to produce colour as
        well as better animation, sprite interaction, and more functionality
        such as a score counter and a high score memory count. This paved the
        way for another popular game, Pac-Man, and Tetris. This also created an
        evolution of arcade games that kids and teens can go to at any arcade
        entertainment centre and insert coins to play.

        During the 1980s, technology was getting better. The invention of
        portable phones like the Motorola MicroTAC, computers such as the Apple
        Macintosh 128k, and a portable radio/music player, the Sony Walkman,
        however,  these types of technologies very expensive. Motorola phones
        would be equivalent to paying $7000 or $5000 for the Apple Macintosh
        128K. But the 1980s introduced a new type of technology that changed the
        video game industry: home consoles. Even though IBM computers have a few
        games and even dial-up motherboards that allow you to play games online,
        they can't beat the invention of the home consoles in the 1980s. The
        invention of home consoles allowed kids and teens to play video games at
        home by connecting the console to their TV and using a controller to
        control their characters in the game. This replaced the experience of
        going to an arcade machine site and inserting coins to play, resulting
        in businesses dying. However, new arcade machines are using new
        technology to improve the gaming experience, such as scan-to-play, which
        uses cards that have NFC technology (the same technology as credit
        cards) to replace the action of inserting coins into the machines.
        <br />
        <br />
        Famous console brands such as Nintendo, Sega, and Atari dominated the
        video games industry by implementing a system where the user could play
        more than one game on their consoles. Players can buy ROM cartridges
        that include a game and play it from their console. This allowed players
        to buy multiple games and play them at home.

        During the 1980s, technology was getting much better, with home consoles
        the size of DVD players and personal computers small enough for
        customers to buy and keep at home. Home consoles were just getting
        better with their colourful, fast-paced animation graphics and the
        classic parallax background effect. Though the consoles were not the
        only ones that were getting better, video games were getting better
        thanks to developers implementing better programming languages such as
        C++. Just look at this gameplay of OutRun Longplay.

        During the 1990s, more technology advanced compared to the arcade
        machines of the 1970s. The internet is a new technology that has
        advanced video games to connect to other people around the world and the
        technology to build modern technology smaller and smaller, like
        cellphones. Video game technology was becoming more powerful and
        compatible with different platforms, such as PCs and home consoles, that
        could run 3D games with fast and amazing graphics, but it got better
        with another innovation: portable game players such as Nintendo Game
        Boys. Players can play video games without the need for an external
        power source or cables, making them portable to take anywhere they go
        while maintaining an enjoyable gaming experience.

        In the 2000s, technology innovation improved with CDs and DVDs that
        replaced the use of floppy discs, which allowed video games to be played
        on different platforms, such as consoles and personal computers, only
        using one certain optical medium. This era also introduces new console
        brands that eventually take over the previous leaders, such as Xbox and
        Playstation, but Nintendo also innovated their game console with
        movement, which was the Nintendo Wii. The technology advancement on the
        Nintendo Wii allows players to interact with video games with motion by
        using an accelerometer and gyroscope technology-based controller that
        creates a unique genre of games such as Wii Sports, in which players can
        play boxing, baseball, tennis, golf, and bowling by creating movements
        based in real life.

        Console and PC gaming are not the only ones that contribute to the video
        game industry. Websites also play an important role in video games. In
        the early 2000s, Java and Adobe Flash sparked new ideas of games on the
        internet that people could play without the need of downloading; these
        websites were making money by showcasing ads, which also introduced
        internet advertisements. 
        <br />
        <br />
        During the 2000s, many portable game players were introduced, such as
        the Nintendo DS and 3DS. But this also led to some mobile phones having
        video games. 
        <br />
        <br />
        The Internet also changed the video game industry by creating an
        experience where multiple users from around the world can play on the
        server, cooperating or fighting each other depending on the type of
        game. When talking about the technology in just games, games were
        incorporating better fluid animation compared to the 8-bit games in the
        80s and the introduction of physics engines that enhanced the collisions
        and object interaction in the game.

        In the 2010s, video games became even more popular due to mobile phones
        and their multitouch technology. which allows users to interact with
        their phones by their finger or hand movements Users can swipe, pinch,
        zoom, and draw unique patterns. This allows for the creation of new
        types of genres, just like the Nintendo Wii's innovations. 
        <br />
        <br />
        With new technology in video games, higher graphics were getting better
        as cathode ray tube-based display units had begun to phase out in the
        2000s and flat-screen TVs were becoming cheaper with high resolution and
        a higher refresh rate, as well as new hardware like HDMI cables that
        support 4K content. Home consoles could showcase other music and media
        streaming platforms, such as Spotify or Netflix. Games companies could
        also find a new way to gather money by implementing transactions in
        their video games by using payment APIs that are secured over the
        internet. This means that players can gain cool items in the game.
        Steam: Steam is the biggest game distribution service. That works by
        selling games digitally to PCs instead of on DVDs or other disc media.
        This will fix the problem for people with damaged or lost discs or those
        waiting for backorders. All users have to do is download the game. This
        helped big game companies cut or lower the cost to manufacture games on
        the medium, which is still present on other gaming platforms. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Another advancement in video games is cross-platform gaming. This allows
        users to play games with other friends no matter which device or
        platform they are using. This works because the game you are playing is
        server-based, and the data, such as stats, achievements, or characters,
        is saved in the cloud. All the game needs to do is synchronise your and
        your friends actions with the server.

        In the 2020s, technology will become more sophisticated but also
        stronger and better. Cloud gaming is sometimes called gaming on demand.
        Cloud gaming is a service that runs the video game on remote servers and
        streams it directly to a user's device. This allows the user to play
        games without the need for a high-end computer and to download large
        games. The first cloud gaming service started in 2003 but failed because
        of low bandwidth. Although cloud gaming today is much better, it will
        become even better with improvements.

        When it comes to virtual reality or VR technology, which is goggles or
        headsets that create a simulated world that can be used for gaming as
        well as training or research, these simulation worlds are in 3D, which
        is able to follow head movements and incorporate auditory and visual
        feedback, making the VR experience realistic.
        <br />
        <br />
        Similar to VR is AR (augmented reality). Augmented games are where the
        game takes a real-time video game image and renders additional graphics
        over it. A common game console that uses AR technology is the Xbox 360
        and Xbox One games using Kinect (motion-sensing input devices that use
        rgb cameras and infrared projects and detectors to capture real-time
        gesture recognition and body skeletal detection). Another game that uses
        AR is Pokemon Go, released in 2016. to show off graphical creatures on a
        background using real-time video from your phone camera.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 2020, one of the two biggest manufacturers of video graphics cards,
        Nvidia and AMD, introduced hardware support for real-time ray tracing
        technology on their latest GPUs. Ray tracing is a type of graphic
        technique that creates light transport from a range of rendering
        algorithms for generating digital images. This technology helps make
        light shadows, reflections, and refractions behave more smoothly. Have a
        look at his video comparison of ray tracing.

        There is other technology that makes games unique with
        close-to-realistic graphics. There are many techniques to make games
        realistic. However, we will be going with only two techniques as there
        are too many. Spatial anti-aliasing is a technique that smooths out the
        edges seen in images while playing games or editing digital photos. This
        technique allows the blues to appear less blue and blends colours to
        make them look natural. You can also see sharp edges, mostly on old 80s
        games that have an 8-bit feel.
        <br />
        <br />
        The last technology we will discuss is DLSS (deep learning supersampling
        fps). DLSS is an image enhancement and upscaling technology that works
        in real time with deep learning AI developed by Nvidia. DLSS helps boost
        the performance of your game without the need for a stronger GPU or
        computer. If you want to play 4K content but can only run 1080p at 60
        fps, you can apply DLSS, which will upscale the resolution while
        maintaining the fps. DLSS can also improve your frame rate if the game
        you want to play struggles with 30 fps. The problem with DLSS is that
        you need games that are compatible with this technology and a decent PC,
        as it will still need processing power to cope with DLSS and the quirks
        of the game such as blur, ghosting, and bad aliasing. However, DLSS is
        still powerful and useful to this day.
